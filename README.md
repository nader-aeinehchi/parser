# Welcome to naderica's parser project
The purpose of this project is extract useful information from source code of an application such this information can be used to train a language model like GPT, DeepSeek or similar.  Your application may have been written in Java, Scala, Python and so forth.

Currently, we are using ANTLR4 as the engine to define the language grammar and to parse the source code.
