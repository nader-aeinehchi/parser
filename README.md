# Welcome to naderica's Code Parser for Language Model Training

This project is a source code parser designed to extract structured information from application codebases. The extracted data is intended for training and enhancing large language models (LLMs) like GPT, DeepSeek, and other similar architectures.

## Key Features:

**Language Support:** Currently supports Java and Scala, with plans to extend parsing capabilities to additional languages like Python.

**Technology:** Built on ANTLR4, leveraging its powerful grammar definitions to ensure accurate parsing.

**Purpose:** Transforms raw source code into a format suitable for machine learning, enabling models to better understand code syntax, patterns, and semantics.
